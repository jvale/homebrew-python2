# Python2 Homebrew Formula

## "...but why? It was EOL'd and you shouldn't use it"
...nor do I want to, but while I'm still stuck with it, I prefer to have a clean way to install it.

This is based on the last version of the formula that was available [upstream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/86a44a0a552c673a05f11018459c9f5faae3becc/Formula/python%402.rb).

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install jvale/python2/<formula>`

Or `brew tap jvale/python2` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jvale/homebrew-python2/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
